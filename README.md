# WorkTime-App
An application that helps in counting the working time. Especially if you work in several projects.

### HOW TO START?

1. Download the project.
2. Add new database "worktimeapp" on the server. E.q in phpMyAdmin. You can find file to import in the project files: "worktimeapp.sql".
3. REMEMBER! If you don't use xampp change access data to mySQL.
4. Use worktime-app/controllers/index.php to start working with app.

I hope that the application will be helpful!
